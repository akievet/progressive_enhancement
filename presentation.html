<!-- "This talk is about how to use progressive enhancement to craft accessible,
  well-structured, and device agnostic code. As a junior developer, I found 
  the world of endless JS frameworks intimidating and chaotic, with battles 
  being waged between evangelists on Twitter. Using progressive enhancement 
  creates a more Zen experience by keeping your codebase simpler and easier to 
  reason about. In a world where new frameworks, libraries, and architecture 
  styles are going in and out of fashion with the seasons, everyone could use a little more Zen." -->

# The What
.center[![Nature](./images/woods.png)]


???

"Progressive enhancement is a strategy for web design that *emphasizes accessibility*, semantic HTML markup, and external stylesheet and scripting technologies. Progressive enhancement *uses web technologies in a layered fashion* that allows everyone to *access the basic content and functionality* of a web page, using any browser or Internet connection, while also providing an enhanced version of the page to those with more advanced browser software or greater bandwidth." -- wikipedia

# Why I Care

class: quote

“Yeah, no, wow, it says you have a lot of Gulp and Angular, 
but I’m guessing you don’t use Fleejob or Grimmex with the 
Snurt extensions? (Long sigh.) I’m just not sure if you’re
gonna like working here.” &mdash; Bloomberg


???

Fed up with 'new hotness' and the insecurities of trying to catch up
Before quote: "JavaScript is fast-moving right now. Too much of what you know today will be useless in six months. Every hard-fought factoid about the absolute best and most principled way to use the language will be fetid zoo garbage by the end of the year. And some sniveling, bearded man-toddler will be looking slightly to your right with his pale, buzzword-infected eyes and awkwardly mumbling,"

class: quote

"a robust site or application in the more traditional sense 
minimizes its dependencies. The minimum dependency for a web 
site should be an internet connection and the ability to parse HTML." 
&mdash; BBC Future Media Standards and Guidelines

???

From her slides. Also, the site says "The core purpose of every document must not require JavaScript or CSS to function"
Two birds, one stone. Have a genuinely good place to begin learning (the basics) and also create a site accessible to all from the start.

# Why?

class: painted-image, margin-top

# Platform

.center[![Picture of wrapped gift](./images/gift.png)]

???

Platforms are static, defined software environments responsible for running neatly packaged bundles of code

---

class: painted-image, margin-top

# Web App

This is the web

# Web != Platform

The web is a continuum.

# Why are HTML/CSS Good and JS Evil?

.center[![Picture of JS Stopping Everything for a little error// Single Point of
Failure](./images/rope.png)]

???

if css and html have behavior unsupported by a browser, they will simply ignore it. Browsers will throw an error and stop processing JS => Single Point of Failure

SPOF: ‘a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. SPOFs are undesirable in any system with a goal of high availability or reliability, be it a business practice, software application, or other industrial system’

JS is an appealing solution as a way to exert control over the web.

# John Allsopp: A Dao of Web Design

.center[![Designer as God](./images/designer.png)]

???

Belief that designers are controllers
Designers want to:
- override the wishes of users and the choices they have made about their viewing experience
- second guess platform differences, caused by different logical resolutions
- all-knowing
- will not tolerate anything less than a rendering on every browser that is pixel perfect with the rendering on their own machine

Legacy of print design 
- dimensions of a page can be controlled
- size of the text
- *facts* of the medium

Facts of the medium of Web: It's adaptable and accessible! Regardless of the browser, platform or screen your reader chooses

.center[![Actions over Looks; Form follows Function (Img of LaCorbusier
building?)](./images/lamp.png)]

???

Your site will not look the same across browsers/devices. Think about what your pages do, not what they look like.

---

# Use HTML to convey information
### Use `em` instead of `i` if you want to italicize for emphasis
### Use form attributes appropriately [find radio button/checkbox anti-patterns]

???

Don't use HTML for presentation

---

#Use CSS to *suggest* appearance. Don't rely on it.
### Downloading fonts might not work. Have a fallback
### Avoid absolute font sizes

???

With CSS you can suggest a number of fonts, but don't rely on a font being available regardless of how common it is.
Screens are less readable than paper because of their low resolution.

# The argument against PE

# Some people will say...

???
Argument Against:
- JS is the baseline in 2015
- Big companies are doing it (Instagram, Sack, Facebook, YouTube, Ebay Pinterest...)
- Programmers should aim to catch errors before they cause problems

---

# Disclaimer: This is sort of a rant.

???

PE comes out of an egalitarian philosophy about the nature of the web. It may not always be the most practical thing to do, but it's good to shoot for.
"oh, that's still a thing?" YES
I'm passionate about it. 
Important for all new developers to hear about, especially in the face of "hot new things" going around in the JavaScript world.
Of course PE might not be appropriate 100% of the time.

# Tips

# Design in text

???

Debate over whether things are Apps vs Documents. If it's on the web, it's probably both!
- Problem: many websites are designed from the UI in rather than from the content out

---

class: painted-image, margin-top

.center[![Hierarchies of Linear structured test](./images/structured_html.png)]

???

Start with the text-based foundation of the website or application you’re designing, and then add the complex interface as a layer on top of this text base.
Benefits: 
- Focus on the structure of textual content
- Irrelevant content becomes easy to spot (not hidden by design)
- Easy to convert from word processor documents into structured plain text

---

## Use a non-distracting text editor

---

class: painted-image, margin-top

## Use Feature Detection

---

## Avoid turning shortcuts and third party code into dependencies

---
class: quote
"Progressive enhancement is the *best* web development strategy based 
on it being *the right thing to do*" &mdash; Jason Garber

---

# Takeaways

---

## Learn and teach core skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

---

## Use PE from the get-go, it's a pain to implement later

---

## PE is cheaper to maintain since simpler code is more maintainable code

---

## Pay Attention to Web Standards 

---

class: quote

"It should be clear our role as designers and developers to 
embrace this flexibility, and produce pages which, by being 
flexible, are accessible to all." &mdash; John Allsopp
