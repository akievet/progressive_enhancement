<!-- "This talk is about how to use progressive enhancement to craft accessible,
  well-structured, and device agnostic code. As a junior developer, I found 
  the world of endless JS frameworks intimidating and chaotic, with battles 
  being waged between evangelists on Twitter. Using progressive enhancement 
  creates a more Zen experience by keeping your codebase simpler and easier to 
  reason about. In a world where new frameworks, libraries, and architecture 
  styles are going in and out of fashion with the seasons, everyone could use a little more Zen." -->

## 1. design in text

  ![Hierarchies of Linear structured test](./images/structured_html.png)
]

---

## 2. use semantic html to convey content

---

.col1[
  ### semantic elements in html5 
  ```html
  <article>
  <aside>
  <details>
  <figcaption>
  <figure>
  <footer>
  <header>
  <main>
  <mark>
  <nav>
  <section>
  <summary>
  <time>
  ```
]

.col2[
  ### use instead of

  ```html
  <div id="nav"></div>
  <div class="header"></div>
  ```

]

---

## 3. use css to *suggest* appearance

---


## 4. use javascript to *enhance*

# takeaways

---

## learn and teach core skills: html, css, javascript

---

## use *progressive enhancement* from the get-go, it's a pain to implement later

---

## *progressive enhancement* is cheaper to maintain since simpler code is more maintainable code

---

## pay attention to web standards
