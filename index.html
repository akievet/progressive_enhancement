<!-- "This talk is about how to use progressive enhancement to craft accessible,
  well-structured, and device agnostic code. As a junior developer, I found 
  the world of endless JS frameworks intimidating and chaotic, with battles 
  being waged between evangelists on Twitter. Using progressive enhancement 
  creates a more Zen experience by keeping your codebase simpler and easier to 
  reason about. In a world where new frameworks, libraries, and architecture 
  styles are going in and out of fashion with the seasons, everyone could use a little more Zen." -->

* if html/css have behavior unsupported by a browser, they will simply ignore it.
* if js fails, browers throw an error and stop processing 
* JS => Single Point of Failure

* SPOF: ‘a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. SPOFs are undesirable in any system with a goal of high availability or reliability, be it a business practice, software application, or other industrial system’

* why doesn't everyone just use semantic html?

* web == new medium
* lack of understanding --> treating medium like something we do know.
* tv + radio --> voiceovers over things views can see

* facts of the medium
  * radio - viewers can't see anything
  * tv - viewers can!

* need to change the belief that designers are controllers

Designers want to:
- override the wishes of users and the choices they have made about their viewing experience
- second guess platform differences, caused by different logical resolutions
- will not tolerate anything less than a rendering on every browser that is pixel perfect with the rendering on their own machine

## graceful degradation vs. progressive enhancement

???

* graceful deg: designing for the best case - modern browser and good
connection. providing alternative experiences in less ideal cases
* prog enh: start by establishing a base level experience accessible to all and
providing an enhanced experience for people who are able to access it
* rachel andrew: "accessibility should never be 'coming'"

## against progressive enhancement

---

.quote["javascript is the baseline in 2015"]

???

* more devices than ever to support
* unreliability of mobile data networks
* hostile browsers - people use outdate browsers

--

.quote["big companies are doing it"]

???

* Instagram, Slack, Facebook, Youtube, Ebay, Pinterest...

--

.quote["programmers should aim to catch errors before they cause problems. we'll just test!"]

???

* sites serving primary content in html require less testing
* good to have a solid base to fall back on, even if you do test

* Next: progressive enhancement is good, but how do I do it?

# how?

]

???

* PH5 Pendant light Poul Henningsen - form follows function.
  * uses three reflecting shades to spread light evenly, illuminating and
  transforming the room with a smooth, glare-free warmth
  * does what it was meant to do elegantly -- doesn't force the light to act
  unnaturally.
  * It's beautiful shape is a brilliant after-effect

* think first: what is the crucial purpose, not how should it look.
* know that your site will not look the same across browsers
* but, the original purpose will still be met - no JS failures

---

## 1. design in text

.main-img--x-small[
  ![Hierarchies of Linear structured test](./images/structured_html.png)
]

???

- Problem: many websites are designed from the UI in rather than from the content out

Start with the text-based foundation of the website or application you’re designing, and then add the complex interface as a layer on top of this text base.
Benefits: 
- Focus on the structure of textual content
- Irrelevant content becomes easy to spot (not hidden by design)
- Easy to convert from word processor documents into structured plain text

---

## 2. use semantic html to convey content

???

* unstyled HTML --> mobile ready! and mobile first!
* starting point for responsive design

---

.col1[
  ### semantic elements in html5 
  ```html
  <article></article>
  <aside></aside>
  <details></details>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
  <figure></figure>
  <footer></footer>
  <header></header>
  <main></main>
  <mark></mark>
  <nav></nav>
  <section></section>
  <summary></summary>
  <time></time>
  ```
]

.col2[
  ### use instead of

  ```html
  <div id="nav"></div>
  <div class="header"></div>
  ```

]

---

## 3. use css to *suggest* appearance

???

* don't rely
* worst case - pages look plain, but info is still there


---

class: top-padding

### avoid absolute font sizes

???

* Screens are less readable than paper because of their low resolution.
* users should be able to specify their default font size
* using relative font sizes, like percentages and ems

---

class: top-padding

### use mobile-first structured CSS

```css

// mobile is default

.my-element {
  width: 100%;
  font-size: 1em;
}

// larger screens get special treatment

@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  width: 40%;
  font-size: 1.2em;
}
```

---


## 4. use javascript to *enhance*
.main-img[
  ![Picture of Modernizr](./images/modernizr.png)
]

???

* use feature detection
  * Modernizr detects which features the users' browser has to offer
  * use results to tailor experience to the user

---

class: center, almost-middle

# disclaimer

???

* pe == egalitarian philosophy about the nature of the web
* may not always be practical, but good to shoot for
* "oh, that's still a thing?" YES
* Important for all new developers to hear about, especially in the face of "hot new things" going around in the JavaScript world.
